# Python based framework for indoor flight of Crazyflie using OptiTrack
This repository includes the Python codes written to achieve controlled and stabilised flight of a Crazyflie drone in an indoor flight arena, using OptiTrack as a method for external localisation in GPS-denied environments 
(To be updated)

To start with, NatNet SDK from OptiTrack website (https://optitrack.com/software/natnet-sdk/) will need to be downloaded onto the host PC.
Once extracted, the folderf "Samples -> PythonClient" will have 3 python codes named "DataDescriptions.py", "MoCapData.py", "NatNetClient.py" (also included in the repository). These python codes must be in the same folder as the main control code.
